## Overview
This project explores how to cluster firms based on **shared financial analyst coverage** and how these clusters evolve over time.  
We construct **firmâ€“firm similarity networks**, embed them with **Node2Vec**, and apply clustering methods to uncover dynamic structures in financial markets.

The analysis focuses on:
- **Graph construction**: firmâ€“analyst bipartite projection using sparse matrix algebra  
- **Embeddings**: Node2Vec with edge duplication to approximate weighted walks  
- **Clustering**: K-means with anchor-based incremental assignment across years  
- **Evaluation**: Cluster stability (tenure, switching rates), return predictability, case studies  

---

## Results (Highlights)
- Clusters show **long-term persistence**, with median tenure â‰ˆ 3 years  
- Switching between clusters declined over time, stabilizing around 5% annually  
- Clusters capture **economic communities** (e.g., retailers, automakers, big tech hybrids)  
- Forward return analysis reveals heterogeneity across clusters, though forecasting remains challenging
